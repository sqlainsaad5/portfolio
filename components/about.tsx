              Currently, I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer specializing in accessibility and modern web technologies. I
              contribute to the creation and maintenance of UI components that power cutting-edge web applications,
              ensuring our platforms meet web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver inclusive user
              experiences.

              In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings â€” from
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium"> advertising agencies</span> and
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium"> large corporations</span> to
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium"> start-ups</span> and
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium"> small digital product studios</span>. Additionally, I also
              released a comprehensive video course a few years ago, guiding learners through building modern web
              applications.

              In my spare time, I'm usually exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or working
              on personal projects that challenge me to grow as a developer. I believe in continuous learning and
              staying up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.
